# Disability-Toolkit

In India, there are about 25 million people having visual, hearing, movement or cognitive impairment. 
These people already have limited access to education and about 12 million lack access to even basic primary education.
The onset of the pandemic has brought nearly all our activities to the virtual mode including education.
Sadly, we have not initiated enough conversations about the digital divide that has been manifested and as we accelerate towards a digital India, and it is high time that we do.
